Fire Vision is the newest tool for fighting fires in the 21st century.  Fire
vision provides a low cost, high quality incident management platform, maximizing
fire team productivity while also maximizing intelligence data on the fire behavior.

Imagine the following scenario.  A fire crew receives a call from dispatch reporting
a brush fire.  Upon arriving on scene, the team begins assessing the situation.
While the team is triaging the situation, one of the crew members grabs a tablet
and launches a drone, which is docked on the fire engine itself.  The drone flies
over the fire and immediately provides a bird’s eye view of the situation for the
crew, as well as data on current wind speed and humidity

Meanwhile, dispatch and other fire crews that are en route to the incident can
also see the birds eye view of the incident, allowing them to maintain operational
awareness as they arrive on the scene, and minimizing the amount of time that the
initial responders must spend communicating the details of the situation.

As additional crews arrive on the scene, the fire continues to grow.  As additional
crews arrive on scene, so do additional drone units.  They are launched, and automatically
space themselves out evenly around the perimeter to provide the fullest possible view
of the incident.

As the incident progresses, incident command takes over.  The multiple drones that
are operating around the perimeter of the fire are providing real time information
on the heat of the fire, the rate of spread in every direction, as well as wind
speed and humidity, both from the national weather service’s forecasts and
measurements taken from tree level.

At the same time, fire perimeter maps and safety information are made available
to the public in real time, allowing the public to stay informed and freeing up
the incident command’s time to focus on strategy.  Current and predicted fire
perimeters, as well as recommended evacuation areas are available to community
safety organizations, police departments, and media outlets.

At the core of Fire Vision is the mobile app, which is used for both communicating
with drone support for acquiring images and data, as well as providing an intuitive
interface for viewing and interacting with the data in real time.  The app features
maps with several critical overlays with data needed for firefighting operations.
These overlays come from the drone sensors covering the incident, stored data from
official sources, and public feeds.  Imagine being able to see in one view not only
the current live fire perimeter on top of a topographic map, but the perimeter itself
is color coded to indicate the rate of spread.  In addition you can overlay existing
structures, hydrant locations, weather forecasts, etc.

But what happens when the fire begins in an area that does not have reliable
internet connectivity?  In this instance the app can connect directly with the
drone to receive all of the data from the drone sensors, and it will use data that
is already pre-cached on the device in order to provide the full experience for
those on the scene.  Once the device regains internet connectivity, it will sync
the data with the backend server so that incident command and remote teams can
see the state of the incident.

Regardless of whether or not the device is online during the incident, all of
the data captured by Fire Vision is aggregated and stored on backend servers so
that it can be analyzed by machine learning to build predictive models and simulations.
This means that during an incident, algorithms built from previous incidents will
be able to predict the fire behavior, taking into account all aspects of the
incident context, including weather, fuel, and topography characteristics as well
as human intervention activities.  This data can also be used for training simulations,
certification exams, public safety, and a myriad of other uses.
